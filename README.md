# Simon Says

## Description  
A physical toy inspired by the classic "Simon Says" game.  
LEDs blink in a random pattern, and the user tries to mimic that pattern.

## Features  
- With each level, the pattern gets longer, increasing the difficulty.

## How to Play  
1. LEDs blink a pattern.  
2. The user memorizes the pattern and attempts to replicate it.  
3. The initial pattern length is one, increasing by one with each level until level eight (the final level).

## Technologies Used  
- **Arduino Uno** — microcontroller platform  
- **LEDs** — for visualizing patterns  
- **Buzzer** — for button press sounds  
- **LCD** — for notifications  

## Installation (for Arduino Uno)  
- Connect four different colored LEDs to pins 6, 7, 8, and 9 on the Arduino.  
- Connect a buzzer to pin 10.  
- Connect four buttons to pins 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the Arduino.  
- Connect LCD pins RS, EN, D4, D5, D6, and D7 to Arduino pins 12, 11, A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively.
